# Expert Systems via Prolog

This is me toying around with Prolog, with interest in using it to build inference engines.

For anyone else with a history of developing in Perl, `.pl` files are Prolog, not Perl. :)

## Mac OS X

You can quickly install `SWI-Prolog` with `Homebrew`:

```
brew install prolog-swi
```

Then run the hello world example:

```
swipl hello_world.pl
```

## Python via PySwip
